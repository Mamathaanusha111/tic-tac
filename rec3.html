<td><p align="justify">To make Idli,four parts uncooked rice (Idli rice or parboiled rice) 
to one part whole white until (black gram,
 vigna mungo) are soaked separately for at least four hours to six hours or overnight, 
 optinally spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the 
 time of soaked for additional flavour. Once done soaking, the lentils are ground to 
 a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground,then they are combined. 
 Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which it's volume will more than double. 
 After fermentation some of the batter may be kept 
 as a starter culture for the text batch.The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds 
 of an idli tray or "tree" for steaming. The perforated molds allow
 the idlis to be cooked evenly. The tree holds the trays above the level of bioling water 
 in a pot, and the pot is covered until the idlis are done 
(about 10-15 minutes, depending on size). A more traditional method is to use leaves instead 
of moulds.</p></td>
